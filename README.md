# ThaumicHorizons_Localization
The temporary repository for localization file of Thaumic Horizons.

Welcome to put localization files into here for temporary usage! Also, keep in mind that here is NOT the official place to submit lang file! That is why I say "temporary".

Note: en_US is only for reference, DO NOT EDIT unless the mod gets updated.
